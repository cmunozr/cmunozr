### Hi! :wave:

Passionate about safeguarding biodiversity and combating environmental degradation, I am a dedicated conservation scientist and global change ecologist. My commitment to science has been shaped by the urgent need to address unprecedented biodiversity loss worldwide. I am deeply interested in understanding how anthropological stressors impact natural systems across different scales and ecological levels, with a focus on devising effective strategies to mitigate devastating biodiversity losses. Currently, I am a doctoral student at Lund University, where I am actively involved in biodiversity research and management.

- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m learning Biodiversity Finance and simulation
