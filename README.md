Currently, I am a doctoral student in Environmental Science at Lund University (SE).

### Research interests

In my research, I am developing and using quantitative models to estimate and predict biodiversity impacts and management. I am particularly interested in evaluating biodiversity metrics to assess how accurately they reflect actual biodiversity states, trends and effectiveness in different management scenarios. I also envision to apply modelling, and optimization approaches to enhance management strategies across various industries impacting biodiversity and validate these methods through case studies, aiming to minimize adverse effects while considering associated uncertainties.
